# PERSONAL
Hi, I'm PolyWCube, or PWC for short.
I intended to create this for my learning and sharing purposes, so I appreciate anyone who could or wanted to join me in my journey.

# EXPECTED
Here are some projects about my learning processes and experiences. I'll keep them as open-source and customized as possible.
I'm the creator of CUSTOM engine, a framework (in progress) which allows people using modules to optimize and customize their own engines.

# Website
I also designed my own website about miscellaneous documents and other stuff.
